# ðŸš¨ SIMPLE FIX GUIDE

## The Issue
Your Cart model has a `coupon` field:
```python
coupon = models.ForeignKey(Coupon, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True)
```

Django automatically creates a `coupon_id` column in the database for this ForeignKey, but the column is missing from your database table.

## ðŸš€ SIMPLE FIX

**Option 1: Direct SQL (Recommended)**
```sql
-- Connect to your PostgreSQL database and run:
ALTER TABLE accounts_cart ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS coupon_id UUID NULL;
```

**Option 2: If IF NOT EXISTS doesn't work:**
```sql
-- Connect to your PostgreSQL database and run:
ALTER TABLE accounts_cart ADD COLUMN coupon_id UUID NULL;
```

## ðŸ“‹ What This Does
- âœ… Adds the missing `coupon_id` column to `accounts_cart` table
- âœ… Resolves the deployment error
- âœ… Allows your application to work normally
- âœ… Minimal change with maximum impact

## ðŸ§ª After Fix
Your application should work without the database errors. The `coupon_id` column will allow Django to properly handle the coupon relationship in your Cart model.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why You Need This
- Your Cart model references coupons
- Django expects a `coupon_id` column for the ForeignKey
- Without it, the application crashes when accessing cart data
- This is a required column for your current model structure
