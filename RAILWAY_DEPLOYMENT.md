# Railway Deployment Guide

## ✅ Health Check Status
Your health check system is **WORKING PERFECTLY**!

### Available Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Response |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `/health/` | Comprehensive health check (DB + cache) | `{"status": "healthy", "checks": {...}}` |
| `/ready/` | Readiness probe (always returns 200) | `{"status": "ready"}` |
| `/live/` | Liveness probe (always returns 200) | `{"status": "alive"}` |

### Railway Configuration
Your `railway.json` is already configured correctly:
- ✅ Health check path: `/health/`
- ✅ Timeout: 300 seconds
- ✅ Restart policy: ON_FAILURE

---

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Railway
Go to your Railway project → Variables → Add:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key-here
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=*.railway.app
```

**Note:** `DATABASE_URL` is auto-provided if you use Railway's PostgreSQL

### 2. Connect GitHub Repository
1. Push your code to GitHub (if not already)
2. Go to Railway Dashboard
3. Connect to your GitHub repository
4. Railway will automatically deploy

### 3. Monitor Deployment
Watch Railway logs for:
```
Running migrations...
Collecting static files...
Starting Gunicorn...
Health check passed!
```

### 4. Verify Health Check
Once deployed, test:
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health/
# Should return: {"status":"healthy","checks":{"database":"ok"}}
```

## 🔍 How Health Checks Work

### During Deployment
1. Railway builds your Docker image
2. Starts your application
3. Repeatedly checks `/health/` endpoint
4. Waits for `200 OK` response (up to 300 seconds)
5. Once healthy, routes traffic to your app

### Health Check Logic
- **Database Check** (CRITICAL): If database fails → returns 503
- **Cache Check** (OPTIONAL): If cache fails → still returns 200
- This ensures your app is marked healthy as long as the database works

### Why This Matters
- Cache (Redis) is optional - app works without it
- Database is critical - app can't function without it
- Health check reflects this priority

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Health Check Fails
**Check:**
1. Is DATABASE_URL set correctly?
2. Is PostgreSQL service running in Railway?
3. Did migrations run successfully?
4. Check Railway logs for errors

**Test locally:**
```bash
python test_health.py
```

### Static Files Not Loading
**Solution:**
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```
This is automatically done by Dockerfile on Railway

### App Won't Start
**Common causes:**
- Missing environment variables (SECRET_KEY)
- Database connection issues
- Migration failures

**Check logs:**
```bash
railway logs
```

## 📊 What Railway Expects

### Successful Deployment
Railway expects `/health/` to return:
- **Status Code:** `200 OK`
- **Response:** JSON with `{"status": "healthy"}`

### Your Current Setup ✅
- Health endpoint: Working
- Database check: Working
- Cache check: Working (doesn't fail on errors)
- Railway config: Correct

---

## 🎯 Testing Locally

Run the test script:
```bash
python test_health.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ PASSED - Health check working!
✅ PASSED - Readiness check working!
✅ PASSED - Liveness check working!
```

---

## 📝 Summary

**Your health check system is production-ready!**

✅ **What's Working:**
- `/health/` endpoint returns 200 OK
- Database connectivity check
- Cache check (non-critical)
- Railway configuration correct
- Error handling robust

✅ **What You Need to Do:**
1. Set environment variables in Railway
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Let Railway deploy automatically
4. Verify deployment with health check

**That's it!** Your health check issue is solved. 🎉
